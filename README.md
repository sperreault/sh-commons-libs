BPL.sh - Boiler Plate
==============

Boiler Plate for Shell (bpl) provides standard functions that can be used in
shell scripts.

These functions range for standard error printing to logging.

Why?
----

Over the years I've searched on the internet to many times to find ways to do
XYZ in a shell script. I've decided to create a stanrdard library for myself.
It's mostly a bunch of snippets from various places. Over the years I have lost
tracks of where I copied the code from, so if you see something you wrote,
please reach out so I can add you to the list of contributors.
